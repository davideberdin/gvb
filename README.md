## Amsterdam tram math

Inspired by the beautiful article written by **Erik Bernhardsson** about the NYC subway system (here the [link](https://erikbern.com/2016/04/04/nyc-subway-math.html)), I decided to do something similar for the Tram lines in Amsterdam. 

I gathered the data from [http://gtfs.ovapi.nl/](http://gtfs.ovapi.nl/) that offers a somewhat real-time data about the public transportation and then run a bunch of scripts to visualize things like: *waiting time*, *delays*, *travel times*, etc.
